# staple-crossovers

Given any DNA origami design the staples will form crossovers accross the scaffold. This code is a visualization to help you see how far along the scaffold these staple crossovers have to go. The code creates two images: (i) a crossover diagram, showing the connection points on the scaffold, (ii) a histogram of the distances the staple crossovers go along the scaffold.

To run this code you need to change the input source and filename of your JSON file that comes out from caDNAno. These are in the first lines of the code for the variables:
  `src`: the location of your JSON files
  `filename`: the name of the specific JSON file to analyze
